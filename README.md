# PYOPP Workshop 2025 - Git tutorial
## Exercise 1

1. Fork this project
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch and work on your assigned issue
4. When you're done, push your changes to your fork
5. Create a pull request from your branch on your fork into the main branch of this repository. Make sure to mention the issue number in your PR (`#<issue-number>`)

## Exercise 2
When your PR got accepted and merged,
1. synchronize your fork with this repository
2. pull the new changes into your local copy of the repository

Once everyone's PR got merged, `python main.py` will produce meaningful output!
